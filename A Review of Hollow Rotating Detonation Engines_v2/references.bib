The pressure gain combustion produced by this class of combustors is poised to produce a step-change increase in the thermodynamic efficiency of gas-turbine engines. The current manuscript is oriented toward presenting a review on the pollutant emission characteristics of these devices; specifically, studies done so far on wave rotor combustors, pulsejet combustors, pulse detonation combustors, and rotating detonation combustors are evaluated. Because of the inherent fluid dynamic unsteadiness peculiar to pressure gain combustion devices, their emissions behavior is not well understood, and is notably different from the more conventional, steady combustors. The global view provided herein is expected to further the understanding of pressure gain combustion systems and ascertain the practicality of implementing them in real-world applications.},

   abstract = {Rotating detonation engines offer the promise of pressure gain combustion in aeronautical combustors where (normally) stagnation pressure decreases. For practical reasons, current experimental rotating detonation engine designs include separate streams of fuel and air injected into a detonation channel. Experimentation with a fully premixed rotating detonation engine has repeatedly failed due to flame flashback into the premixed plenum. That fundamental problem is the subject of this paper: understanding the relevant principles and parameters that contribute to flashback and investigating a scheme for arresting the flashback phenomenon. This investigation quantifies the flashback susceptibility for a proposed rotating detonation engine feed slot with parameterization of channel height, channel length, equivalence ratio, fuel type, and feed pressure. The design principles of quenching distance and critical boundary-layer velocity gradients are shown to describe the safe operation region to deliver a safe premixture of fuel and air to a rotating detonation engine when adjusted for experimental conditions and applied in unison. This research leads to a design that is capable of avoiding flashback while enabling detonation to occur in a rotating detonation engine.},

The experimental results reveal that the propagation speed of detonation waves increases with the rise of mass flow rates and is greater than the Chapman-Jouguet detonation speed (VC-J). Furthermore, numerical simulations of rotating detonation in a non-premixed three-dimensional cylindrical combustor have been conducted based on a multispecies reacting code. The influence of two mixing schemes - that is, slit-orifice and coaxial injector - on detonation waves are studied to determine whether the characteristics of detonation waves tend toward high-frequency combustion instability due to changes in the mixing scheme. It is found that the slit-orifice scheme's detonation speed, pressure, and temperature are significantly higher than those of the coaxial injector scheme. In particular, the detonation speed of the former reaches 124% of the VC-J, while that of the latter is only 80.5% of the theoretical value. The numerical results reveal that the low-speed detonation is caused by the deterioration of the hydrogen (H2)/air mixing conditions. Moreover, the flow-field structures of two mixing schemes were comparable, both containing transverse detonation waves, oblique shocks, contact surfaces, and wedge-shaped reactant regions. Furthermore, the Rayleigh index analysis showed that the unsteady heat release was in phase with the pressure fluctuations, amplifying the pressure. Therefore, it is suggested that high-frequency combustion instability may be a manifestation of rotating detonation waves under poor mixing conditions.},

As each set of injectors created its own detonations, the synchronized detonation waves propagated along the three injector rows. From the axial view, those detonation combustion regions stood off from the injector surface as the non-well-mixed propellant existed between the wall and the combustion zone. This combustion region tended to broaden in lateral and radial directions as the mass flow rate increased by pushing its region with the injected propellant. Wall heat flux and heat balance were evaluated by a one-dimensional unsteady heat transfer model with propellant injection cooling. Even when the flow rate was doubled, the increase in the wall heat flux was only 18–25%. This heat trend and the image of standoff self-chemiluminescence from the injector surface implied that a non-well-mixed unburned propellant acted as a heat-reduction layer to ease heat load into the combustor. Measurements and thermal analysis verified the flow structure near the injector and heat-exchange mechanism due to the propellant gas flow, which has a potential for thermal steady operation.},

   abstract = {Continuous Rotating Detonation (CRD) shares many similarities with the High-Frequency Tangential Instability (HFTI) in liquid rocket engine, and it may be one cause of the HFTI. To investigate the self-sustaining mechanism of CRD/HFTI, a pintle-like injection scheme is adopted in this paper, and series of ethylene-air tests have been conducted. The pintle injector effects on the CRD operation range have been analyzed firstly. By decreasing the diameter of pintle injector, the lean equivalence ratio boundary increases, and the primary combustion mode transfers from CRD to sawtooth-wave mode. By increasing the insertion length, the enlarging of the head recirculation zone is helpful for the realization of multi-CRD waves. Based on the high-frequency pressure results, the propagation characteristics of single-wave, two-waves and sawtooth-wave modes are detailed. Theoretical intrinsic frequencies of the hollow chamber have been calculated and compared with the test results. The single-wave and two-waves modes show good agreements with the first tangential and second tangential theoretical results, respectively, with the relative deviations within just 6%. But the frequency of sawtooth-wave mode is much less than the first tangential theoretical value, and the deviation reaches about 20%. Because the diameter of traditional rocket pintle injector is much smaller than that of combustor, CRD cannot be achieved due to the propellant deficiency around the outer combustor, leading to the depress of HFTI. This paper could improve the understanding of the self-sustaining mechanisms of CRD and HFTI.},

As the injection position moved downstream, the propagation mode of CRD waves appeared in the order of single-wave mode, co-rotating two-waves mode, and lifted-single-wave mode. The axial heat release rate of the former two modes were rapid, indicating that CRD waves propagated near the ethylene orifices. Typically, for CRD wave of single-wave mode, a high peak pressure (about 0.7 MPa) led to a local backflow of propellants in the head recirculation zone. The lifted-single-wave mode was a new propagation mode where the CRD wave was ‘lifted’ from the ethylene orifices. For this mode, the CRD wave propagated with little velocity deficit (8 %) but lower peak pressure (about 0.2 MPa). Besides, the axial heat release rate was much slower in this mode, indicating that the detonation wave propagated in the unburned propellants and the intermediate products of the upstream deflagration. The achieved propagation modes were significantly affected by the ethylene injection position, which was supposed to be related to the variations of matter and energy exchanges between the main stream and the combustion products in the central recirculation zone.},

   abstract = {Wall-detached continuous rotating detonation (CRD) was experimentally and numerically achieved in the designed hollow chamber. For this novel CRD wave, the pressure signals measured at the chamber wall showed lower peak pressure but much higher frequency when compared with typical wall-attached CRD. Meanwhile, the high-speed photographs showed that the luminous area (i.e. coupled reaction zone) of this CRD wave always varied within a “wall-detached” cylindrical zone. Experimental results with different ribs further proved that the CRD wave propagated within a cylinder whose diameter was about 44 mm, and the corresponding propagation velocity was very close to that of C-J detonation. A model was proposed to illustrate the flow field structure of this special CRD. According to the annular injection position of propellants, the hollow chamber was divided into two parts, namely, central CRD zone and outer shock wave zone. The detonation wave propagated within the former zone and the induced oblique shock waves stretched in both of the two zones. These two waves rotated synchronously to form the basic flow field structure of this wall-detached CRD. This model was further verified by a premixed numerical simulation case. The wall-detached propellants injection was believed to contribute to the formation and self-sustaining of the detonation wave in the center, and the oblique shock waves were induced on both sides due to the lateral expansion effect. This study shows that the detonation wave could rotate spontaneously and continuously without the support of chamber wall. The analyses on the propagation characteristics as well as the flow field structure of wall-detached CRD contribute to the understanding of self-sustaining mechanism of CRD wave in the hollow chamber.},

In this paper, ammonia-oxygen continuous rotating detonation (CRD) was firstly proposed and realized in the hollow chamber with Laval nozzle. The formation process and propagation characteristics were investigated through pressure measurement and optical observation. The CRD wave formation time increased with the nozzle contraction ratio, which was mainly attributed to the slower injection recovery process under the higher chamber pressure. The operation range was large, and the CRD wave propagated in single-wave mode with the velocity of 1806 m/s in the chosen test. The propagation velocity did not increase continuously as the equivalence ratio increased, which could be attributed to the changeable reaction mechanisms and the slow heat release of ammonia. The coupling of ammonia injection and CRD wave propagation was analyzed under both supersonic and subsonic injection conditions. The synchronous fluctuations of the pressure in ammonia plenum and the intensity of detonation waves proved that the coupling was very tight under subsonic injection condition. This paper was beneficial to the improvement of the detonation theory, and it provided an efficient approach to the utilization of ammonia.},

In this study, the ammonia/oxygen-enriched air continuous rotating detonation (CRD) was first realized in a hollow chamber.

An analysis of the integral of chemiluminescence (ICI) was conducted based on images obtained using high-speed photography to reconfirm the stable propagation of the CRD wave. In the experiment, the ammonia CRD could be realized when the oxygen mass fraction (OMF) was at least 43%. The operating range clearly decreased as the OMF decreased from 83% to 43%. The axial ICI peak gradually moved downstream with reductions in OMF and equivalence ratio, indicating afterburning of the ammonia CRD. The enhanced combustion downstream led to a circumferential excess of the CRD wave structure downstream, which was verified through CRD flow-field reconstruction.},

   abstract = {Rotating detonation engines (RDEs) have been actively researched around the world for application to next-generation aerospace propulsion systems because detonation combustion has theoretically higher thermal efficiency than conventional combustion. Moreover, because cylindrical RDEs have simpler combustors, further miniaturization of conventional combustors is expected. Therefore, in this study, with the aim of applying RDEs to space propulsion systems, a cylindrical RDE with a converging–diverging nozzle was manufactured; the combustor length [Formula: see text] was changed to 0, 10, 30, 50, and 200 mm; and the thrust performance and combustion mode with the different combustor lengths were compared. As a result, four combustion modes were confirmed. Detonation combustion occurred with a combustor length of [Formula: see text]: that is, a converging rotating detonation engine. The thrust performance of this engine was 94 to 100% of the theoretical rocket thrust performance, which is equivalent to the thrust performance of conventional rocket combustion generated at [Formula: see text]. This study shows that detonation combustion can significantly reduce engine weight while maintaining thrust performance.},

Research is also being actively conducted worldwide on a cylindrical RDC; a RDC without an inner cylinder. which is expected to simplify and downsize the combustor. However, most of the research was performed using gas propellants, and liquid propellants were rarely used. Since liquid propellants used in many combustors, it is important to evaluate the performance of RDCS with liquid propellants. In this study, a cylindrical RDC with a liquid ethanol-gas oxygen mixture was constructed and tested at a flow rate of 31.5 ±5.0g/s, an equivalence ratio of 0.46-1.39, and a back pressure of 14.5 2.5 kPa. The thrust was shown to depend strongly on the combustor bottom pressure history. In addition, the start-up process of the cylindrical RDC with liquid fuel was clarified by self-luminous and CH radical visualizations. It was found that the detonation wavefront propagated at a distance of 2-3 mm from the combustor bottom, and the main combustion region was 10-15 mm in height.},

Diagnostics included high-frequency chamber pressure measurements, chemiluminescence imaging of the combustor annulus (aft looking forward), and particle image velocimetry measurements at the exit plane of the engine and tangent to the center body. Detonation surface plots are created from chemiluminescence images and allow for the extraction of properties such as dominant mode frequencies and wave number, speed, and direction. Dynamic mode decomposition is also applied to the chemiluminescence images to isolate various spatial modes within each test. Singular-spectrum analysis is used to isolate modes corresponding to the detonation frequency in the signals of velocity components obtained from particle image velocimetry, maintaining instantaneous phase information. Results from a case with a primary mode corresponding to a single wave rotating clockwise with a minor wave rotating counterclockwise are presented. Results from a case with two detonation waves rotating clockwise in the combustor annulus are also presented. The dominant chamber frequency for the case with two co-rotating waves in the chamber is found to be 3.46 kHz, corresponding to two individual waves traversing the annular combustion chamber at average speeds of 68% of the Chapman-Jouguet velocity. Dynamic mode decomposition indicates the presence of two major detonation waves rotating clockwise and periodically intersecting with two minor, counterclockwise rotating waves in the annulus during operation. Axial and azimuthal components of velocity from this case are observed to remain nearly in phase and are determined to correspond to the two minor, counterclockwise rotating waves.

   abstract = {The formation of a number of co- and counter-rotating coherent combustion wave fronts is the hallmark feature of the Rotating Detonation Engine (RDE). The engineering implications of wave topology are not well understood nor quantified, especially with respect to parametric changes in combustor geometry, propellant chemistry, and injection and mixing schemes. In this article, a modeling framework that relates the time and spatial scales of the RDE to engineering performance metrics is developed and presented. The model is built under assumptions of backpressure-insensitivity and nominally choked gaseous propellant injection. The Euler equations of inviscid, compressible fluid flow in one dimension are adapted to model the combustion wave dynamics along the circumference of an annular-type RDE. These adaptations provide the necessary mass and energy input and output channels to shape the traveling wave fronts and decaying tails. The associated unit processes of injection, mixing, combustion, and exhaust are all assigned representative time scales necessary for successful wave propagation. We find that the separation, or lack, of these time scales is responsible for the behavior of the system, including wave co- and counter-propagation and bifurcations between these regimes and wave counts. Furthermore, as there is no imposition of wave topology, the model output is used to estimate the net available mechanical work output and thermodynamic efficiency from the closed trajectories through pressure-volume and temperature-entropy spaces. These metrics are investigated with respect to variation in the characteristic scales for the RDE unit physical processes.},

   abstract = {Proposed is a phenomenological modeling framework that is capable of reproducing the diverse experimental observations of the nonlinear, combustion wave propagation in a rotating detonation engine (RDE), specifically the nucleation and formation of combustion pulses, the soliton-like interactions between these combustion fronts, and the fundamental, underlying Hopf bifurcation to time-periodic modulation of the waves. In this framework, the mode-locked structures are classified as autosolitons or stably propagating nonlinear waves where the local physics of nonlinearity, gain, and dissipation exactly balance. We find that the global dominant balance physics in the RDE combustion chamber are dissipative and multiscale in nature: The fast combustion physics provide the energy input to form the fundamental mode-locked autosoliton state, while the slow physics of exhaust and propellant recovery shape the waveform and dictate the number of autosolitons. In this manner, the global multiscale balance physics give rise to the stable structures - not exclusively the frontal dynamics prescribed by classical detonation theory. Experimental observations and numerical models of the RDE combustion chamber are in strong qualitative agreement. Moreover, numerical continuation (computational bifurcation tracking) of the RDE analog system indicates that a Hopf bifurcation of the steadily propagating pulse train leads to the fundamental instability of the RDE, or time-periodic modulation of the waves. Along branches of Hopf orbits in parameter space exist a continuum of wave-pair interactions that exhibit solitonic interactions of varying strength.},

High-frequency pressure results indicated that increasing mass flow rate shifted the detonation propagation mode from a dual-wave mode with quasi-detonation and detonation mutual transition (comprising three submodes: periodically coupling oscillation, random coupling oscillation, and coupling oscillation with variable wave number) to a single-wave mode with strong instability and finally to a stable single-wave mode. The predetonator was found to play an important role in the stability of detonation propagation. It could bring about injection instability that interacts with the RDWs. Therefore, this interaction, as well as the detonation strength, affects the propagation mode of RDWs. If the predetonator resonated longitudinally, it largely impacts the RDW propagation mode. In the single-wave mode with a lower _m (e.g., 246.4 g∕s), the injection instability may cause the propagation frequency to increase, but from the long-term trend, the detonation propagation stability is enhanced with an increase of _m.},

Experiments were conducted at atmospheric backpressure and under various injection conditions (different mass flow rates of CH4/O2 gaseous mixture). The injection conditions, together with the time domain and frequency domain characteristics of the high frequency pressure, have been analyzed. A high speed camera was employed to roughly record the reaction zone structure. Results show that for the given test mode working with lower mass flow rates - 38gs-1 CH4 and 131.7gs-1 O2 (leading to an equivalence ratio of 1.154), CRDWs occurred but were not stably propagating. In contrast, stably propagated CRDWs were observed in a four-wave mode when mass flow rates were increased to 36.1gs-1 CH4 and 217.2gs-1 O2 (leading to an equivalence ratio of 0.665). The corresponding average frequency and average velocity of the CRDWs were 19.251kHz and 1512ms-1, respectively. FFT and STFT discussions on the high-frequency pressure history of CRDWs validated the stability of rotating detonation waves in the hollow chamber. This study further verified the feasibility of triggering the CRDW in a unique hollow combustion chamber through annular injection distribution. Injecting enough combustible mixture is the essential condition for sustaining a stable CRDW.},

In order to investigate the characteristics of methane-air CRD wave in a small chamber, three hollow chambers with Laval nozzles are adopted in this research. The methane-air CRD can be realized in a quite small chamber (diameter of 80 mm) under very particular condition. The operating range enlarges with the increase of chamber diameter. The CRD wave propagation frequencies vary apparently with chamber diameter while the propagation velocities stay in a quite narrow range of 1744–1812 m/s, and the relative deviation is within 4%. The CRD wave propagation process is very stable, and the propagation velocity accounts for 99% of the theoretical C-J velocity in the chosen test. Optical observation results illustrate that the reduction in chamber diameter or increase in nozzle contraction ratio will lead to CRD deterioration. By comparing the frequencies of high-frequency pressure and optical observations, the coupling of inducing shock wave and combustion flame is proved quantitatively.},

The pressure at the exit was less than one-fifth of the maximum pressure in the RDE, significantly below the value for a sonic flow. The results suggested that the exhaust flow was supersonic, with values up to Mach 1.7, without the need of a converging section within the engine. In addition to the estimated Mach number from the measured pressure, the exhaust plume images coherently indicated the existence of supersonic exhaust.},

   abstract = {This paper considers, analytically and experimentally, the feasibility of a rocket motor utilizing a detonation wave rotating in an annular combustion chamber wherein the propellants are introduced continuously through the injectors and expelled through an annular nozzle. Experiments utilizing gaseous hydrogen and oxygen and gaseous methane and oxygen were conducted in a small-scale annular rocket motor. A breakable diaphragm extending across the annular chamber and a baffle plate extending outside the chamber were required to achieve a single detonation wave propagating in one tangential direction. A single Chap-man-Jouguet wave was realized successfully for the first cycle but subsequent cycles of the wave were not obtained. It is believed that the injector pattern with the consequent high turbulence level, premature burning, and limited mass flow characteristic was a major part of the difficulty. The analyses conducted indicated that such a motor is feasible and therefore worth consideration in view of the possible advantages mentioned in the introduction. However, the primary need at this point is for experimental measurements under actual operating conditions.

The significant distinction of the sawtooth wave and the CRD wave in the coupling characteristics is confirmed through Short-Time Fourier Transform processes on ICI and highfrequency pressure. For the CRD wave, the propagation frequency of the reaction zone matches that of the pressure wave, whereas not for the sawtooth wave.

The pressure sensors can accurately sample up to 500 kHz while the strain gauge can sample up to 100 kHz, both greatly exceeding the Nyquist rate for the instabilities observed in the RDC used for this study. Through comparative analysis, strain sensors are evaluated as a tool to determine the detonation wave speed, measure extemporaneous acoustics, and quantify the wave strength through peak pressure. Initial findings indicate that the frequencies observed by the strain sensor very closely resemble chamber pressure fluctuations, while its use as a tool to quantify wave strength will require further study.},

The result suggests that the closer the location is to the outer wall, the stronger the counter-rotating shock wave is. A method of controlling the wave direction is proposed. It is shown that the intensity of the counter-rotating shock wave is controlled by reducing the total pressure of the inlet, and then the direction of the detonation wave is controlled. The process of detonation wave reversing is divided into four steps, namely, counter-rotating shock waves evolve into detonation waves, several detonation waves are extinguished, detonation waves form again, and detonation waves propagate stably. The mechanism of wave direction control is investigated. The result shows that the fluctuation of the total pressure of the inlet stimulates the positive feedback interaction between the counter-rotating shock wave and the fresh gas, which causes initial detonation waves to be extinguished and the intensity of counter-rotating shock waves to become stronger and stronger, and eventually counter-rotating shock waves evolve into reverse detonation waves.},

The propagating velocity behavior of rotating detonation waves and counter-rotating shock waves is discussed, and the mathematical model of the counter-rotating shock wave is proposed and verified. The results show that there is a clear quantitative relationship between the counter-rotating shock wave and the peak periodic undulation phenomenon of the pressure time curve, that is, the wave packet. This mathematical model connects the counter-rotating shock wave phenomenon in the experiment with the wave packet phenomenon in the experiment. The influencing factors of the counter-rotating shock wave are studied. The results show that increasing inlet total pressure and decreasing nozzle shrinkage ratio can significantly weaken the counter-rotating shock wave in a combustor. Based on this, the relevant parameters of rotating detonation engine (RDE) can be optimized to make the rotating detonation propagate more stable and therefore make the RDE operate more stable, which is of great significance to the practical application of RDE.},

   abstract = {The counter-rotating shock wave phenomenon and instability mechanisms in the hollow rotating detonation combustor with a Laval nozzle are investigated. The in-house solver BYRFoam based on the OpenFOAM platform and the detailed chemical reaction kinetic mechanism are used. The coupling of the detonation wave and the shock wave is revealed, with the continuous presence of the counter-rotating shock wave in the combustor that propagates in the opposite direction to the detonation wave and oscillates in intensity. The intensities of both the detonation wave and the counter-rotating shock wave are found to be constantly oscillating, and this instability is referred to as the collision-oscillation instability. It is caused by the complex interaction between the detonation wave, the fresh gas and the counter-rotating shock wave. The velocity difference between the detonation wave and the counter-rotating shock wave is found to lead to the migration of the collision point, which in turn leads to the peak periodic undulation phenomenon of the pressure curve, that is, the wave packet. This instability is called the counter-rotating instability, which co-exists with the collision-oscillation instability for a long time. The results of this study are compared with the experimental data, and the reasons for the oscillation of the experimental pressure signal are explained.},

The instantaneous pressure and temperature fields show the characteristics of propagating waves are different depending on the injector configuration. From the spatiotemporal average profiles, the combustion occurs more rapidly in the case of injection from the bottom. However, the case of injection from the side wall also shows the consumption of fuel. Compared to the theoretical values, the specific impulse is 106 % from the bottom and 103 % from the side.

   abstract = {Three different rotating detonation engines (RDEs) were investigated in this paper to better understand the impact of removing the centerbody on performance under realistic operating conditions. The baseline configuration is taken from earlier work on an RDE concept at altitude 12,800 m and Mach 2.5. Three RDEs were investigated, two annular RDEs, one with an aerospike nozzle, and one with a convergent-divergent (C-D) nozzle attached behind the combustion chamber. The third RDE was a hollow RDE with a C-D nozzle, with the outer wall profile based on the annular RDE with a C-D nozzle. Manifold conditions were considered that produced perfect expansion for the C-D nozzles given a steady combustion process. Two more sets of simulations were done with off-design conditions above and below the target pressure. Results showed that the wave pattern within the combustion chamber was consistent between all six configurations, with only minor differences between them. Exit and throat conditions were reconstructed for all simulations and used to determine the thrust, ideal Effective Available Pressure, and pressure gain. Based on exit conditions, the RDE/aerospike combination had the worst performance with thrusts ranging from 2.15 to 3.35 kN, whereas the RDE/C-D nozzle combination had the best performance at 2.42 to 3.85 kN. The hollow RDE was typically slightly lower than the RDE/C-D nozzle at 1.97 to 3.65 kN. The throat conditions showed significantly different results. The RDE/aerospike combination had the best pressure gain (1.17 to 1.21), followed by the annular RDE/C-D nozzle combination (0.93 to 1.10), followed by the hollow RDE/C-D nozzle combination (0.87 to 1.08). The PG=0.87 and 1.97 kN was an outlier (single-wave, low pressure), whereas all the other hollow RDE/C-D results were only slightly less than the annular RDE/C-D nozzle results. These results demonstrate that properly matching the exit areas to the injection flow-rates for the hollow RDE should produce similar performance as an annular RDE.},

   abstract = {Two different centerbody-less rotating detonation combustors were investigated in this paper and compared to an annular RDC, to elucidate some of the physics that occur within these combustors as well as to determine their performance. Centerbody-less RDCs are interesting because removal of the wall has several advantages, assuming similar efficiency and stability can be demonstrated. The geometries were based on an older, small 0.10 m diameter annular RDC. The hollow RDC had the centerbody removed and replaced with a head-end wall at the injection plane of the RDC. The flow-through RDC had the centerbody removed and the core domain extended upstream of the detonation wave to isolate the inflow of the core. The feed pressure and temperature were 10 atm and 325 K, the injector area ratio was 0.2, the back pressure was 1 atm, and the surface injection area ratio was 0.19 for all of the centerbody-less designs. The core flow for the flow-through RDC was specified from 325-650 K and from 150 m/s-450 m/s, and was all at 1 atm. The simulations showed that the resulting flow-field was very similar to the better studied annular RDCs, but included pressure relief into the central region which lowered the pressure ahead of the detonation wave for all of our centerbody-less configurations. Placing an exhaust plenum behind the RDC was essential for our computations, particularly for the hollow RDC calculation. The detonations were stabilized by artificially making the flow more reactive (reducing the induction time) for the centerbody-less designs compared to the annular RDC, although it is unclear whether this was simply because of the initialization we chose or just a characteristic of the conditions. Further work will focus on the performance as it relates to several parameters in the ideal configuration studied here, and also towards simulating the experimental rigs currently using a centerbody-less design.},

In this paper, a series of numerical simulations of H2/air RDE are performed to show the plume flowfield of a RDE in detail and to obtain the pressure distribution on the end faces of the inner cylinder and the outer wall. The thrust force of the RDE is calculated with/without considering the two end faces to show its effect on the propulsive performance. Then the effects of the total massflow rate and the environment pressure on the propulsive performance are discussed. Under high environment pressure condition, the inner cylinder end face brings a notable disadvantage of the propulsive performance due to the strong suction effects. This disadvantage disappears under low environment pressure condition. The fluctuation of the total thrust force is dominated by the outer wall end face. As the massflow rate increases, the engine's thrust force becomes more steady. Under low environment pressure condition, the engine's thrust force is very stable and its fluctuation can be neglected. Under high environment pressure conditions, the use of the conventional thrust calculation formula overestimates the average thrust force and underestimates the unsteadiness of the thrust force obviously.},

For a hollow RDE without Laval nozzle, there is only one rotating detonation wave in the combustion chamber. Compared to the traditional annular RDE, the mixing quality is deteriorated, and the thrust of the engine decreases and becomes more unstable. When the hollow RDE is attached with a Laval nozzle, there are two rotating detonation waves in the combustion chamber. The pressure within the combustion chamber increases while the axial velocity decreases. The mixing quality is improved. The height of detonation waves decreases with larger contraction ratio of the nozzle. A Laval nozzle is beneficial for a hollow RDE to achieve steadier operation and higher thrust output. When the contraction ratio is 4, the propulsive performance of the engine is the highest. The maximum thrust achieved is 840 N.},

Using the one-step chemistry kinetic model and the Euler equations in cylindrical coordinates, a series of three-dimensional (3D) numerical simulations are performed to find out whether detonation waves can propagate in such combustors. The results show that this new RDE combustor model can realize energy conversion in rotating detonation. The fuel-based specific impulse can reach around 7000 s. By comparing the results of hollow and annular combustors, some important differences are observed though general behaviors in these two RDE combustor models are similar. One is that there is no repeated reflection of shock waves in the hollow model. Another is that in the center of the cylinder part of fresh gas rolls inward into the region r<Rinner and here the RDE experiences some non-detonation burning. Also, through the comparison and analysis, roles of the outer and inner walls are presented. Without the restriction of the inner wall, burnt gas flows a little more divergently.},

As the rotating detonation wave is of high periodic and unsteady features, the film cooling characteristics inside the rotating detonation combustor are very complicated. To illustrate the influence of rotating detonation wave on the flow dynamics of coolant jets and the thermal protection performance of film cooling in the rotating detonation combustor, a numerical investigation is performed in the current study, on the base of a simplified physical model wherein only single row of film cooling holes in the axial direction is concerned. The results show that both the blocking effect and oscillating effect occur in the transverse jet injection, upon the impact of sweeping of detonation wave and oblique shock wave. Due to the occupancy of momentary combusting flow invasion into the film cooling hole during one cycle of wave sweeping, the inward flow from the film cooling hole to the combustor chamber is not the pure ‘coolant jet’ but instead of a ‘mixed’ jet. The blocking effect of sweeping oblique shock wave front on the coolant jet injection is significantly weaker when compared to the detonation wave front. With the use of film cooling, the time-averaged temperature on the outer wall of the combustor chamber is reduced effectively, especially in the middle and rear sections of the rotating detonation combustor. The coolant jet injection does not change propagation speed of the rotating detonation wave but reduces a little the peak pressure and peak temperature of each cycle.},

A long test, lasting more than three seconds, was performed in this unique configuration, indicating that the cylindrical isolator–combustor engine exhibits potential for practical applications. Three distinct combustion modes were revealed with varied equivalent ratios (hybrid mode, sawtooth wave mode, and deflagration mode). The diameter of the nozzle throat was critical in the formation of rotating detonation waves. When the nozzle throat diameter was larger than the specific value, the detonation wave could not form and self-sustain. The upstream boundary of the shock train was supposed to be close to the isolator entrance in conditions of a high equivalence ratio and small nozzle throat diameter. In addition, it was verified that periodic high-frequency pressure oscillation could cause substantial impacts on the incoming flow as compared with the steady deflagration with the same combustor pressure.},

Two air injection areas with gaps of 1.778 mm and 3.81 mm were used at different air mass flow rates of 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 kg/s and equivalence ratios from 0.6 to 2 in 0.2 increments. Results show repeatable detonations for hydrogen-air mixtures in both configurations; however the detonative range is wider, stronger and faster in the hollow configuration. Speeds exceeding the Chapman-Jouguet velocity and pressures matching the ideal model were observed. Sustained detonations for ethylene-air mixtures were not attained with the flow-through configuration. Installing a back plate to convert the configuration into a hollow combustor promoted rotating detonations with the ethylene-air mixture at select operating points. The results of this study showcase the strong promise of producing and sustaining rotating detonation in non-annular RDC configurations.},

   abstract = {A three-dimensional numerical simulation of rotating detonation engine (RDE) with hollow combustor is performed to analyze wave structure evolution systematically. Wave structure evolution is classified into four categories, namely two-wave collision (counter-rotating waves), abscission of detonation tail, and shock wave to detonation transition. Two-wave collision consists of symmetric detonation collision, asymmetric detonation collision, and detonation/shock collision. Two symmetric detonation waves turn into shock waves after collision. Collision of asymmetric detonation waves creates single detonation wave. The detonation/shock collision decreases the detonation wave intensity. Abscission of detonation tail and shock to detonation transition can both create single detonation wave or two opposite-direction detonation waves, depending on the wave hitting angle and the amount of fresh gas. All phenomena mentioned above affect the number of detonation waves in the combustion chamber.},

When the air mass flow rate is 1.5 kg/s, the equivalence ratio is 0.98, and the total temperature of the mixture is 650 K, the stable rotating detonation wave (RDW) is obtained, which verifies the feasibility of the designed two-phase rotating detonation combustor (RDC). It is found that there is a high-frequency oblique shock induced by the upstream rotating detonation wave in the isolation section. A series of experimental tests have been carried out by changing the total temperature of incoming air, which is an important factor affecting the initiation. When the equivalent ratio of reactants is between 0.950–1.152, a stable single-wave detonation is formed. With the increase of equivalent ratio, the time of detonation wave establishment decreases, the intensity and frequency of detonation wave increases, and the temperature of engine tail flame rises. The equivalent chamber pressure Δpφ was defined, and the curve of the performance of the RDC with the equivalent ratio was obtained. The velocity of the RDW increases with the increase of equivalent ratio, and the chamber pressure has an optimal value, a higher or lower equivalent ratio will lead to the decrease of equivalent chamber pressure and the combustion chamber performance.},

   abstract = {This article presents a numerical study on the rotating detonation engine (RDE). The simulation explores the phenomenon of the reinitiation of detonations in the RDE with a cylindrical combustion chamber. The process is modelled by the three-dimensional reactive Euler equations with an Arrhenius form of the reaction rate for the premixed stoichiometric hydrogen-air mixture. The detonation flow goes through three stages: initiation, quenching, and spontaneous reinitiation. The detonation fronts collide with each other and also have frequent collisions with the outer wall after initiation. While there is a possibility of generating new detonation fronts from the explosion, it is also likely that the explosion will burn out the surrounding reactive mixtures and snuff out the detonation waves. The simulation shows that a strong collision between two detonation wave fronts extinguishes the detonation flow and consequently renders the engine inoperative for an extended period until a spontaneous reinitiation occurs in the flow. The reinitiation is found to be triggered by a rapid and sharp increase of pressure near the chamber wall.},

   abstract = {This study evaluated the propulsion performance of a nozzleless, cylindrical rotating detonation engine (RDE). Using a C2 H4 –O2 mixture, the RDE was tested in a low-back-pressure environment at propellant mass flow rates of 8–45 g/s. In high-speed imaging of the self-luminescence within the combustor, rotating luminous regions were observed at mass flow rates above 22 g/s. Measured pressure distributions suggest that burned gas reached sonic velocity at the combustion chamber outlet. This paper proposes the structure of internal flow in the RDE and confirms that calculated pressure distribution based on the structure was close to the experimental distribution. This study also estimated the RDE’s thrust by pressure and momentum exchange and confirmed it by experimental measurement. Moreover, the theoretical thrust calculated under the assumption that exhaust is a sonic flow agreed with the load cell thrusts, suggesting that RDE combustion is perfectly completed inside the chamber. Specific impulses are 80–90% of specific impulses for ideal correct expanded flow for all mass flow rates, and its value was close to that of an annular RDE. In addition, RDE performance will increase by about 20% if the RDE is equipped with a divergent nozzle and the gas is correctly expanded to back pressure.},

In the present paper, two different ignition methods, named hot-jet and constant-pressure respectively, are adopted to compare the tangential instability and rotating detonation. The results show that, comparing with hot-jet method, when the contraction ratio of the nozzle is small, the realization of rotating detonation by constant pressure method is impossible. Three different combustion patterns have been found and characteristics of pressure oscillations have been discussed. When the contraction ratio is 10 and 12, the intrinsic frequencies of the test mode have been computed. Based on the pressure oscillations and the dominant frequency, the results are compared with the intrinsic frequency of combustion instability. The results show a good coincidence with each other. The non-linear tangential instabilities observed in rocket engines may actually be a manifestation of this rotating detonation wave mechanics in the hollow chamber with Laval nozzle. The work shows the possibility of detonation in a hollow chamber with Laval nozzle. It will enrich detonation wave theory and make a contribution to connecting the detonation and tangential instability.},

Based on its character, a new type of detonation is defined as two dominant peak one wave mode (TDPO). The velocities of detonation waves propagating in this new mode are larger than the Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) theoretic value. On the assumption that the reflection wave is rotated with the detonation wave, this mode is well illustrated. The forming process of two waves is also given. The results show that the appearance of combustion mode is relative to the reflection wave generated at the contraction section of the nozzle. The inner mechanism of the refection wave is illustrated. These works make a foundation to investigate the relationship between rotating detonation and tangential instability.},

   abstract = {The origin and chaotic propagation of multiple detonative waves in the two-dimensional modelled rotating detonation combustor fueled by premixed hydrogen/air mixtures are numerically investigated with detailed chemical mechanism. The discrete reactants inlets are adopted, to mimic the spatial non-uniformity of the propellant in the practical Rotating Detonation Engine (RDE) combustor. The emphasis is laid on the mechanism to induce the new detonation waves in the RDE and the influence of the reactant non-uniformity in RDE on the critical detonation combustion dynamics. The numerical experiments show that the stability and number of the rotating detonation wave are affected by the inlet total pressures and reactant equivalence ratios. The RDE with high inlet total pressure would experience chaotic instability before reaching stable propagation of detonation waves in near-stoichiometric mixtures, while for the RDE with low inlet total pressure, no chaotic propagation transient after the detonation initiation is observed. It is found that the chaotic propagation stage is responsible for the variation of the rotating detonative wave number and propagation direction. Frequent detonation extinction, re-ignition and re-orientation, irregular reactants refill zones, co-rotating and counter-rotating detonation waves are observed during chaotic stage. The explosive spots arising during this stage, which may initiate new detonation waves, result from the mutual enhancement between the travelling shock waves and the deflagrative fronts. Furthermore, the predictability of the chaotic detonation wave propagation is further confirmed in terms of the initial and boundary conditions, mesh and chemical mechanism. It is also found that the fuel equivalence ratio has a considerable impact on the number of the stabilized detonation wave and velocity deficit.},

Experimental results indicate that four propagation modes have been obtained, i.e. the single wave mode, the sawtooth wave mode, the periodic oscillation mode, and the deflagration mode. The sawtooth wave mode and the periodic oscillation mode are considered unstable modes. In the single wave mode, the average propagation velocity of rotating detonations in the annular combustion chamber with a combustor width of 15 mm is between 1121 and 1215 m/s. The minimum velocity deficit is 21.9%, and the relative standard deviation of the propagation velocity is less than 5%, which is much lower than the experimental results of other studies utilizing ethylene and air in the annular combustors.

As the simulations are achieved at the local scale of a single injection element, only one periodic pattern of the whole geometry can be calculated so that the travelling detonation waves and the associated chemical reactions can not be taken into account. Here, separate injection of fuel and oxidizer is considered because premixed injection is handicapped by the risk of upstream propagation of the detonation wave. Different associations of geometrical periodicity and symmetry are investigated for the injection elements distributed over the injector head. To analyse the injection and mixing processes, a nonreacting 3D flow is simulated using the LES approach. Performance of the studied configurations is analysed using the results on instantaneous and mean flowfields as well as by comparing the mixing efficiency and the total pressure recovery evaluated for different configurations.},

Pressure signals are obtained at different circumferential and axial positions on the RDC. Equivalence ratios ranging from 0.6 to 1.0 and air mass flow rates ranging from 25 to 225 g/s are used in the experiments. The operating diagram includes fast deflagration (FD), unstable detonation (UD), quasi-stable detonation, and stable detonation sub-regions characterized by the combustion mode. The results indicate that the occurrence of fast deflagration is mainly determined by the fuel-injection conditions and the acoustic properties of the annular combustor. The alternating occurrence of FD and detonation is typically observed in the UD region; therefore, the speed fluctuation of the wave propagation is very high, usually changed from 65% to 75% of its mean speed. In the quasi-stable detonation region, the FD completely disappears, but single/double-detonation wave inversion occurs. The statistical probability of the inversion of the single-detonation wave is approximately 10% of the 100 test runs conducted in the quasi-stable detonation region. In the stable-detonation region, a stable-detonation wave is formed and propagates stably without wave inversion or splitting. The speed and pressure fluctuations of the stable detonation wave are less than 15% of the mean ones. The present results serve as a guide for the design and practical application of rotating detonation engines.},
